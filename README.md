# stackify

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Tauri** - Build native desktop applications
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Before Deploying to Cloudflare

When you are ready to deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers, you'll have to make a couple changes.

- Change your url environment variables to match your `*.workers.dev` domains generated by Cloudflare:

```bash
# apps/web/.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL={your-production-server-domain}

# apps/server/.env
CORS_ORIGIN={your-production-web-domain}
BETTER_AUTH_URL={your-production-server-domain}
```

- In `packages/authentication/src/index.ts`, uncomment the `session.cookieCache` and `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` sections and replace `<your-workers-subdomain>` with your actual workers subdomain. These settings are required to ensure cookies are transferred properly between your web and server domains.

## Deployment (Alchemy)

- Dev: pnpm run dev
- Deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: pnpm run destroy
